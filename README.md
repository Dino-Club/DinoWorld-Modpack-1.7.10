# DireClanMC Modpack 1.7.10
This is the official modpack required for DireClanMC 1.7.10 server. This modpack contain mods that allow you to use computers, travel to outer space, make a railway network, build a electrical grid, and more!

## Downloads
The modpack will be available on CurseForge, but for now, will be available on GitHub. We are also working on a custom launcher that will auto-update your modpack (and launcher) for you.

## Installation
For those with vanila launcher, make sure to have [Forge 1.7.10 Latest](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html) installed, then download `Mods_for_Vanilla_Launcher-x-x-x.zip` and extract its content into `/.minecraft`. (This will work the best if you have multiple instance of Minecraft and uses launcher like MultiMC). But if you are using ***PURE*** vanilla launcher, please backup your Minecraft files before using our modpack. In some case, our release may be missing a mod, which will not let you join our server. If a problem like this happen, please make a issue ticket.

For those with Twitch/Curse/etc launcher, you should download `DireClanMC-x.x.x.zip`.

### Twitch Client Installation

First, you need to get the client [here](https://app.twitch.tv/download). After you have it signed in, Go to the `Mods` section on the purple menu bar. Click on `Minecraft`. Now click on `Create a Custom Profile`, a menu will pop up. Under the giant `Create Profile`, click on the Import hyperlink, select on `DireClanMC-x.x.x.zip` from where ever you saved it. It will take atleast a minute for Twitch to install the files needed to run the modpack.

### MultiMC Client Installation

Coming soon


Before you can use this mod, be sure you have a strong CPU and 3GB of memory dedicated to Minecraft. SSD is also recommended, but not needed.
