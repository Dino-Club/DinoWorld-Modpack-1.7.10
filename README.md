This is the official modpack required for DireClanMC 1.7.10 server. This modpack contain mods that allow you to use computers, travel to outer space, make a railway network, build a electrical grid, and more!

## Downloads
The modpack is available on CurseForge and GitHub for those that does not use Twitch Client. (Details below). ~~We are also working on a custom launcher that will auto-update your modpack (and launcher) for you.~~

## Installation
For those with vanila launcher, make sure to have [Forge 1.7.10 Latest](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html) installed, then download `Mods_for_Vanilla_Launcher-x-x-x.zip` and extract its content into `/.minecraft`. (This will work the best if you have multiple instance of Minecraft and uses launcher like MultiMC). But if you are using ***PURE*** vanilla launcher, please backup your Minecraft files before using our modpack. In some case, our release may be missing a mod, which will not let you join our server. If a problem like this happen, please make a issue ticket.

For those with Twitch/Curse/etc launcher, you should download `DireClanMC-x.x.x.zip`. (This is for if something happens to CurseForge or they simple just reject our newest update)
